# OpenCV
**Computer vision** is an exciting field of artificial intelligence that teaches computers to interpret and understand the visual world by using digital images from cameras and videos, and sophisticated deep learning models. By accurately identifying and classifying objects in the visual world, computer vision allows machines to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions based on what they "see".

**OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)** is a library of programming functions mainly aimed at real-time computer vision. Originally developed by Intel, it was later supported by Willow Garage then Itseez. The library is cross-platform and free for use under the open-source BSD license.

Here are some projects & their applications which can be build using openCV:-

## 1. Face Blur

Use GaussianBlur with a kernel of (91,91) to blur faces. It can be used for Privacy & Identity Protection in public/private areas. Can increase or decrease blur strength by changing the kernel.

## 2. Color Transfer

Used one image color (source) to change the color of different image (target) using both Color Transfer Algorithm as well as color_transfer modules. It can be used to apply different types of color filters.

## 3. Live Sketch

convert an image or a video into a sketch.

## 4. Extract Faces From An Image

A simple Python program that can extract faces from an image is a valuable tool for improving the accuracy of face recognition applications. Developers can implement robust algorithms that quickly and accurately detect faces in an image, crop the image to isolate the face, and save it as a separate image file for further analysis or processing. This program can be used to build a wide range of applications, including security systems, and more.

## 5. Color Detection

Color detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Color detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps. Some Real-world Applications:-

- In self-driving car, to detect the traffic signals.
- Multiple color detection is used in some industrial robots, to performing pick-and-place task in separating different colored objects.
